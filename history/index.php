    <h2>The History of Kempsville Masonic Lodge No. 196 A.F.&.A.M</h2>

    Dispensation Granted: June 28, <a href="/years/1954.php">1954</a><br>
    Chartered: February 9, <a href="/years/1955.php">1955</a>
    
    <p>The meetings were held on the second Tuesday of every month except
      February, which were held on the third Tuesday so as not to conflict
      with Grand Lodge session.</p>

    <p>This is a story that must be told before we relive the recorded
      history of this lodge. I was pleased to be in a group of young
      Freemasons when a couple of Past Masters related this account for
      our Masonic Education and I am pleased to pass it on so as time
      passes, it will not fade. I was told: </p>

    <div style="margin-left:30px">
      <p><i>A finer group of Freemasons could never be found than those who
	  founded Kempsville Lodge No. 196 - all were dedicated true members of
	  the craft, many with titles and honors they had received from their
	  Brothers. Others, just good old Master Masons who wore their white
	  apron proud. Everyone was a worker in the quarries of our great
	  fraternity.</i></p>

      <p><i>The word was out that a Masonic Lodge was desired in the Kempsville
	  area; everyone at the meeting was in agreement.
	  The plans were laid, other meetings scheduled, and those in
	  attendance commenced accepting donations in preparation to request
	  necessary papers from Grand Lodge; Peace and Harmony prevailed. The
	  meeting being held in one of the Brother&#39;s "Cow Barn" was off to a
	  good footing. Many hours of work by many dedicated Masons provided
	  our lodge for us to enjoy.</i></p>
    </div>

    <h2>Recorded History</h2>
    <p>One hundred and sixty nine years after Kempsville Lodge No. 12 was
      founded, Kempsville Lodge No. 196 was granted dispensation in <a href="/years/1954.php">1954</a> to
      begin work. It was placed in the 56th Masonic District.</p>

    <p>Our meeting place was the old Davis Corner Fire Station on Davis
      Street off Virginia Beach Boulevard. The first stated meeting was
      held on July 13, <a href="/years/1954.php">1954</a> with the following officers in their stations
      and places:</p>

    </div>

    <p>The lodge continued to grow and prosper and it was time for the
      members to look for a building site to construct a lodge building of
      our own. A plot was located in Kempsville just across from Miller&#39;s
      Dairy. It is the site of the present High&#39;s Ice Cream store. A short
      period of time passed and a good brother let us swap this piece of
      land for our present location.</p>

    <p>Our membership was 28 when first formed and the Good Lord has
      blessed this Lodge from day one and its membership is now over
      400. When first formed, the members stated if all went well when the
      membership reached 400, another lodge would be formed. This was done
      and Willis V. Fentress Lodge No. 296 was chartered in <a href="/years/1968.php">1968</a>.</p>

    <p>Permission was granted to construct a Masonic Temple in the year
      <a href="/years/1956.php">1956</a> and at the May Stated Meeting the plans were drawn. One year
      later, May <a href="/years/1957.php">1957</a>, the foundation was laid.</p>

    <p>Worshipful Brother A. M. Powers tells this story, and I have let
      the names remain as a token of love and appreciation.</p>

    <div style="margin-left:30px">
      <p><i>This is what took place when the building plans were put into
	  progress. That Saturday morning, the stakes and lines were
	  set. Ground was broken for the foundation, all was ready except the
	  south/back wall. When Brother John Fiske departed about noon he
	  stated that no concrete was going to be poured that day.</i></p>

      <p><i>Brother Powers, after a short discussion with Al Bonney, asked
	  how soon can that back foundation be dug?</i></p>

      <p><i>Block was delivered and Brother Peacock gave instructions on how
	  it was to be laid. Al Bonney kept the hot dogs and sandwiches
	  coming. The Brethren and outsiders assisted in the work of digging
	  the hardest ground anyone had ever seen in their lives. The
	  foundation was dug and concrete poured that afternoon and on June 1,
	  <a href="/years/1957.php">1957</a> the cornerstone ceremony was performed by Right Worshipful
	  W. V. Fentress. Brother Tyler took pictures of the building&#39;s
	  progress. Brother Talbot tore his hand on removing our first set of
	  chairs from the old Norview Theatre. Brother Hall received bad burns
	  while working on the electrical panel. All in all, the Good Lord
	  blessed us in our undertaking of this Masonic Temple.</i></p>
    </div>

    <p>The pillars, Jachin and Boaz were presented by Brother
      Morealus. Brother McCauley presented the working tools. Both are
      still in service to the Craft today.</p>

    <p>At our first Stated Meeting in May <a href="/years/1957.php">1957</a> in our new building, our
      members sat on 2x4&#39;s and cinder-block. Peace and Harmony continue to
      this day.</p>

    <p>Much was done by our founding Fathers for us to enjoy our present
      Masonic Temple and since that time the Masters, Wardens, and
      Brothers of Kempsville Lodge No. 196 ahve continued in the spirit of
      Friendship and Brotherly Love to continue their Good Works.</p>

    <p>A finer group of Freemasons could never be found than those
      responsible for our existance. To them we say, "Well done, our True
      and Faithful servants."</p>

    <p>It is my hope you have enjoyed this brief history of your
      Lodge. Many of the names of today&#39;s leaders and active members are
      omitted for fear of overlooking someone of great importance, in the
      construction of the Temple. Our history is a proud one on the
      records of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Virginia and at a
      later date I hope to do another paper, fitting of the proper respect
      to our founders.</p>

    <p>I must thank Right Worshipful L. R. Snyder, Worshipful Pete Powers,
      and Brother Grady McGuire for assisting me in the most enjoyable
      task which was assigned me by Worshipful Raymond E. Hall, Jr.</p>

    <p>Fraternally,<br>
      Worshipful Richard A. Davis, Jr. (<a href="/years/1975.php">1975</a>)<p>
